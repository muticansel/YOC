    paragraph: `In May 2001 a Porsche hung from a crane in Berlin with the message
        “Cash or Crash?!” – In just one week, around 100k mobile phone users
        voted via text whether the cash value of the Porsche should be
        raffled or the car should be dropped. Finally, it fell to a depth of
        more than 50 meters. We realized the power of mobile and how you
        could reach out and engage with people. That’s when YOC – ‘Your
        Opinion Counts’ – was born. Back then this slogan was describing
        YOC’s business: Reaching people on their mobile devices and providing
        them with the information, they were really interested in. Not much
        has changed since then. Our vision remains reaching people on their
        most personal device, entertaining them and generating a desire for
        new products and brands. Technology has changed rapidly however and
        YOC has successfully progressed and evolved every step of the way:
        Best mobile-first advertising is what still drives us to develop new
        products and solutions every day.`,
